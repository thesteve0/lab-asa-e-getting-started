You might have already an application to work with, but in this guide we're going to use a simple
application and we're going to guide you through the process to create a Spring Boot application ready to
be used in Azure Spring Apps. You can learn more of the process in link:spring.io[spring.io]

. Create app on start.spring.io
 Keep all the defaults

. Then just add the Spring Web Dependency

*NOTE* I think we can avoid all this if we just add this minimal code to the Workshop Image. Then they can avoid start.spring and we can open a page in an editor

. For the code it will be really ugly but also really simple.

```java
 //these need to be added
 import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
 import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

// Add the RestController Annotation
 // This let's us respond at / with a string
 // REMEMBER - this is not a good pattern to use for a normal application
 @RestController
 @SpringBootApplication
 public class DemoApplication {

----
  public static void main(String[] args) {
     SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }

  // Add this whole section which defines what to do when the user requests
  // the base URL of our website.
  @RequestMapping("/")
  public String helloSpring(){
     return "hello spring";
  }
----

}
 ```

*NOTE* Make sure to emphasize this is for instructional purposes only and only to demonstrate how to work with ASA-E

. Run it locallyâ€¦..

Now you should be ready to move your application into Azure Spring Apps.
