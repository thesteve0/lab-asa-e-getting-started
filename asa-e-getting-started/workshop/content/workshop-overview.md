# Getting Started with Azure Spring Apps Enterprise

Welcome to the workshop to help you get started with Azure Spring Apps Enterprise (ASA-E). The code and examples in this workshop are kept intentionally simple to help you focus on the new concepts and patterns of working with ASA-E. The goal of the workshop is to get you familiar enough with ASA-E that you know where and how to start digging in to do the more interesting work.

If you are an advanced Java user or someone who works with Azure, but not ASA-E quite a bit, there is still good information in here for you. Just expect to skip or move through some content more quickly.
